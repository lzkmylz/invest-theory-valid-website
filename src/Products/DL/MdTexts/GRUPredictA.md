# Background

The prices of a stock can be seen as time series sequence. And the performance of a stock in one trade day can be divided into two categories -- Up and Down. Then, the problem can be abstract to predict a two categories classification based on given time series sequence.

For this product, the GRU is used to build a RNN to finish predict. In training and testing, the accuracy of predict is about less than 70%. Hope such predict result can help you make better invest decision.
